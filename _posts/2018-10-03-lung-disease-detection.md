Here's some basic text.

Here's some *italics*

Here's some **bold** texts.

What about a [link](https://github.com/taiftahmid)

Here's a bulleted list: 
- First item
- Second item

Here's a numbered list: 
1. First
2. Second

Python code block:
'''python
    import numpy as np
    
    def test_func(x,y):
        z = np.sum(x,y)
        return z
'''

Here's some inline code 'x+y'. 

Here's an image:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/lungdiseasedetection.jpg" alt="x-ray image">

Here's some math: 
$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
